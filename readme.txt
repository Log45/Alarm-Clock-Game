Alarm Clock Game is a program intended to be used on either a microcontroller or a raspberry pi. 


Currently, Alarm Clock Game creates a tkinter GUI with an array of buttons (determined by the user) and prompts the user to press buttons that turn red.
Once the user presses 6 buttons, the program closes itself. 


Eventually, this will have a more refined "Simon-Says" type game, and while the game is ongoing, an alarm will be sounding in the background which will turn off when the user reaches a determined score limit.
